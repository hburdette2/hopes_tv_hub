# Technologies used were HTML; CSS; JS; JQuery

I started with the HTML to the basic structure and then did the CSS styling to give it the look I wanted. 

Next I connected to the api and made sure I got data returned in the console. 

Then I created line items for item I wanted to display and that I wanted the api to push data to. 

# Unsolved Problems

I can get one item to return but not any item I want.
